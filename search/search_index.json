Graduating as an Electrical and Electronic Engineer, it was a Raspberry Pi 2B that convinced me to \"detour\" my career focus into software development. I've been a Software Developer ever since and continue to dive into the tech world. Whilst being a Python Guy , I have fun building games with PhaserJS and Pygame . Which helps me to further understand the importance of DRY concept and OOP . What stuck in my mind now is, Django or FastAPI ? Experiences You can view my \"standard view of Experiences\" from my linkedin page, or you can read my \"not-so-point-form\" article. Software Developer [APR 2021 to current] Currently working remotely at avodaq pte ltd , occasionally travel to Singapore for events and team-building. Dynatrace has been the main product use to help customer achieve observability. Hence, our development works mostly circulating around Dynatrace . To prolong the data retention, we develop a plugin via AppEngine (Dynatrace plugin) which is in React + Typescript . I get my hands on with FastAPI to develop the report generator based on Dynatrace metrics and backup into S3 bucket. To diversify the product focus, we develop a Booking Application integrating with Webex UC devices. Stacks used for frontend are Ionic with Angular , while backend are Django . My first career 'detour' that led me into software development was at Nosairis sdn bhd , which involved going through a coding challenge to assess my abilities in Python , particularly the Django framework. We developed multiple tools to help automate inhouse day to day operation, collecting logs by SSH into routers, report generation, deriving issue by matching keywords in log, visualizing log, etc.. The main product focus is asset management. Where we combined RFID technology to scan and update asset status into the system. Action such as \"Inbound\", \"Outbound\", \"Audit\" can be done like \"scan and go\". We also developed an IoT Project - Water Monitoring System, where a centralize monitoring platform collecting data from water sensors across pump station via MQTT protocol to achieve Live data. Stack and tools commonly use for development: Python , Django , ExpressJS , Docker , Nginx , AWS , VueJS . Sales Executive [SEP 2018 to APR 2021] My exploration period - from Sales Engineer in Fuji Electric to Senior Sales Executive in Fujifilm. In between this period is where I get my hands on a Raspberry Pi 2B. Electrical Engineer [MAR 2013 to AUG 2018] Yes, you read it right. I am a graduate Electrical and Electronic Engineer. I designed electrical circuit, specification, authority submission for new building plan. Subsequently, become Senior Product Design Engineer for Fujitec Pte Ltd .
